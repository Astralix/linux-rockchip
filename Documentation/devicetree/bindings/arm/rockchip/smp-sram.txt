Rockchip SRAM for smp bringup:
------------------------------

Rockchip's smp-capable SoCs use the first part of the sram for the bringup
of the cores. Once the core gets powered up it executes the code that is
residing at the very beginning of the sram.

Therefore a reserved section has to be added to the mmio-sram declaration.

Required node properties:
- compatible : should contain both "rockchip,rk3066-sram", "mmio-sram"
  so that the smp code can select the correct sram node.

The rest of the properties should follow the generic mmio-sram discription
found in ../../misc/sram.txt

Example:

	sram: sram@10080000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3066-sram", "mmio-sram";
		reg = <0x10080000 0x10000>;
		mmio-sram-reserved = <0x0 0x50>;
	};
