* Synosis DesignWare APB Watchdog

The Watchdog controller is used for resuming system operation
after a preset amount of time during which the WDT reset event has not
occurred.

Required properties:
- compatible : "snps,dw-apb-wdt"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- clocks : the periphal clock of the controller.

Example:

	watchdog@2004c000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-wdt";
		reg = <0x2004c000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&wdt_clock>;
	};
